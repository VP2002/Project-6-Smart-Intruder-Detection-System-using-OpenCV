Building a Smart Intruder Detection System
with OpenCV and your Phone


Problem Statement: The project aims to develop a smart intruder detection system using
computer vision techniques and mobile phone cameras. Traditional home surveillance
systems can be costly and complex to set up. This project addresses the need for a simpler
and more affordable solution by leveraging the capabilities of mobile phone cameras and
OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.

Objective: 
The objective is to create a system that can:
1. Access a live video stream from a mobile phone's camera to OpenCV on a PC.
2. Use motion detection algorithms to identify intruders in the video feed.
3. Record video samples whenever an intruder is detected.
4. Send alert messages to the user via the Twilio API.

   
Conclusion: 
By implementing this project, users can build a cost-effective and efficient
intruder detection system for home surveillance. The system offers flexibility by allowing
users to use their mobile phone cameras or IP cameras for video streaming. Additionally, it
provides real-time alerts and video recording capabilities, enhancing security and peace of
mind for homeowners.
